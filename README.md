# Introduction Lab

---

## Overview

**Introduction Lab** is a reverse-engineering project designed to replicate the smooth scroll-based animation from the [2019 IAD Lab website](https://2019.iad-lab.ch/). The focus is on reproducing the **S-shaped animation** behavior, where images and pop-up text appear as the user scrolls through the page. The design uses placeholder images and text, with attention to responsive and fluid animation.

## Features

- **Smooth Scroll Animation**: The scroll interaction is divided into three parts. Initially, the first section is visible, followed by the middle and lower sections as the user scrolls down.
- **Dynamic Placeholders**: The project uses images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and placeholder text generated by [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/).
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.
- **Technology Stack**: Developed using **JavaScript**, **CSS** (or animation libraries like GSAP), and modern tools for scroll handling.
