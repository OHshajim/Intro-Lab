## Overview

This project is a reverse-engineering exercise to replicate the scroll animation from the [2019 IAD Lab website](https://2019.iad-lab.ch/). The primary focus of this challenge is to recreate the scroll-based animation, with images and pop-up text that follow an **S-shaped structure** as the user scrolls.

## Features

- **Smooth Scroll Animation**: The scroll behavior transitions images and text in three parts. The first part is initially visible, followed by the middle and lower parts as the user scrolls.
- **Images & Placeholders**: Images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) are used along with placeholder text from [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/).
- **Fully Responsive**: Ensures a smooth experience across devices.
- **Technology Stack**: Built using JavaScript, CSS (or libraries like GSAP if applicable), and any necessary libraries for handling the animations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
